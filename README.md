Movie Audience Prediction
=========
Hypothesis
----------
Many people in South Korea judge a movie by its cover. They usually consider two factors, the director and actors, when deciding whether to watch the film. Therefore we have developed a model with a machine learning algorithm that has the least root square error to estimate the audience prediction.


Method
----------
* Source: KOBIS (Korea Box-office Information System, 2003~2019)  
* ML model: KNN regressor  
* Label: Number of audience  
* Other columns: film name, film distributing company, film rating, film genre, film actor, film director
